> How to Become a YouTube Influencer
So you have a talent you are passionate about pursuing and are looking to increase your visibility by putting your skills in front of a larger audience. The cheapest and easiest way to do this may very well be from the comfort of your own home. With your computer, internet, and some simple equipment (hello, smartphone), you could be on your way to being the next big YouTube influencer.

A YouTube influencer is a content creator who has established a large following on the video platform.

You may have heard this term thrown around on social media or in conversations with friends, but aren’t quite sure what it really means. Put simply, a YouTube influencer is someone who builds a substantial following on the video platform of YouTube, sets trends, and provides information for others looking to purchase a specific product or service, for example. Some of the most popular YouTube influencers are performing artists, visual artists (including makeup artists), and athletes. Creating videos on YouTube allows them to share their skills and make them easily accessible.
